# DevOps Automation Assistant - HLD Components Explained

## 1. System Overview
- **Purpose**: Intelligent DevOps automation system using Google Agent Development Kit (ADK)
- **Architecture**: Modular design with specialized agents for different DevOps domains
- **Integration**: Connects to external systems via Model Context Protocol (MCP)
- **Core Value**: Centralizes DevOps operations through intelligent agent orchestration

## 2. Core Architecture Components

### 2.1 DevOpsOrchestratorAgent (Root Agent)
- Acts as the central decision maker routing tasks to appropriate specialized agents
- Uses hybrid orchestration model:
  - Simple tasks delegated via `AgentTool` pattern (immediate execution)
  - Complex tasks transferred via ADK's built-in transfer mechanism (context switching)
- Makes routing decisions based on keywords and task complexity in user requests
- Ensures optimal resource utilization by selecting the right specialist for each task

- **MonitoringAgent**:
  - Specialized in system metrics and performance analysis
  - Transferred when user asks about monitoring, metrics, or performance trends
  - Connects to Thanos MCP server via HTTP for comprehensive metrics analysis
  - Offers insights into system health, resource utilization, and performance bottlenecks

- **CICDPipelineAgent**:
  - Specialized in CI/CD pipeline operations
  - Currently in development (TODO)
  - Will handle build triggers, pipeline monitoring, and deployment automation
  - Planned to integrate with Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and other CI/CD platforms

- **InfrastructureAgent**:
  - Specialized in infrastructure provisioning and management
  - Currently in development (TODO)
  - Will handle VM, container, and network provisioning through Terraform and cloud APIs
  - Designed to work with AWS, GCP, Azure, and on-premises infrastructure

- **DeploymentAgent**:
  - Specialized in application deployment operations
  - Currently in development (TODO)
  - Will handle deployments, rollbacks, and release management across environments
  - Will ensure consistent, reliable application delivery with proper validation

## 3. MCP Integration Architecture

### 3.1 Elasticsearch MCP Server
- **Function**: Bridge between the ElasticsearchAgent and actual Elasticsearch clusters
- **Key Tools**:
  - `test_connection`: Verify Elasticsearch accessibility and cluster health
  - `list_indices`: Discover available log indices for analysis
  - `get_mappings`: Understand log structure and field types
  - `search`: Execute complex Elasticsearch queries for log retrieval
  - `esql`: Run ES|QL queries for simplified log analysis
  - `get_shards`: Monitor shard distribution and health
- **Benefits**: Abstracts Elasticsearch complexity, provides secure access, enables robust error handling

### 3.2 Kubectl-AI MCP Server
- **Function**: Secure interface between KubectlAIAgent and Kubernetes/OpenShift clusters
- **Key Tools**:
  - `oc`: Execute OpenShift CLI commands with proper authentication
  - `bash`: Run system-level commands for advanced operations
- **Security Features**:
  - Token-based authentication
  - Command filtering to prevent destructive operations
  - Environment isolation for safe execution
- **Benefits**: Enables cluster operations without exposing credentials, ensures compliance with best practices

### 3.3 Thanos MCP Server
- **Function**: Interface between MonitoringAgent and Thanos/Prometheus monitoring systems
- **Key Tools**:
  - `query_metric`: Execute instant PromQL queries for current metric values
  - `query_range`: Execute range queries for historical data analysis
  - `list_metrics`: Discover available metrics in the system
  - `get_metric_metadata`: Get detailed information about specific metrics
  - `explore_labels`: Explore label names and values for metrics
  - `analyze_trends`: Perform advanced trend analysis on metric data
- **Benefits**: Centralized metrics access, trend analysis capabilities, performance insights

## 4. Configuration Management
- **Primary File**: `config.yaml` contains all system configurations
- **Configuration Sections**:
  - Agent settings (model selection, streaming preferences)
  - DevOps tool configurations (API keys, endpoints for various services)
  - Elasticsearch connection settings (URL, credentials, SSL options)
  - Kubernetes connection settings (cluster URLs, authentication tokens)
  - Monitoring system settings (Thanos URLs, authentication, timeouts)
- **Security**: Sensitive information stored in environment variables, not in config files
- **Flexibility**: Easy environment-specific configuration through YAML structure

## 5. Data Flow and Processing Patterns

### 5.1 Simple Task Flow
1. User submits a simple request (calculation, search)
2. Orchestrator identifies it as a tool task
3. Appropriate tool agent (SearchAgent/CodingAgent) executes immediately
4. Results are formatted and returned directly to user

### 5.2 Complex Task Flow
1. User submits a specialized request (log analysis, cluster operations)
2. Orchestrator transfers context to the appropriate sub-agent
3. Sub-agent takes control with domain-specific expertise
4. Agent uses MCP tools to interact with external systems
5. Results are processed with domain-specific understanding
6. Response is formatted and returned through orchestrator to user

## 6. Extensibility Features
- **New Agents**: 
  - Create by inheriting from BaseAgent class
  - Implement required methods (get_system_prompt, create_agent)
  - Register in the main orchestrator
- **New Tools**: 
  - Add functions to agent's tool list
  - Use FunctionTool wrapper for ADK compatibility
  - Register in agent's get_tools() method
- **MCP Servers**: 
  - Standard interface for connecting to external systems
  - Implement using FastMCP framework
  - Expose functionality through decorated functions
- **Configuration**: 
  - All settings managed through YAML files
  - Environment-specific overrides supported
  - Easy to extend with new configuration sections

## 7. Security Considerations
- **Credential Management**: 
  - Sensitive data stored in environment variables
  - MCP servers handle authentication securely
  - No hardcoded credentials in source code
- **Command Execution**: 
  - Input validation on all tool parameters
  - Filtering of potentially dangerous commands
  - Secure subprocess execution in MCP servers
- **Network Security**: 
  - SSL/TLS support for all external connections
  - Certificate validation options
  - Timeout configurations to prevent resource exhaustion

## 8. Scalability and Performance
- **Agent Isolation**: 
  - Each agent runs independently
  - Resource usage can be monitored and controlled per agent
  - Easy to scale individual components as needed
- **Asynchronous Processing**: 
  - MCP servers use async/await patterns
  - Non-blocking operations for better throughput
  - Efficient resource utilization
- **Caching Strategies**: 
  - Connection pooling for external systems
  - Result caching for frequently requested data
  - Optimized data retrieval patterns
